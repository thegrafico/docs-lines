# Dots and Box

Dots and Box Game
Take more boxes than your opponent. You move by connecting two dots with a line. 
When you place the last ‘wall’ of a single square (box), the box is yours. The players 
move in turn, but whenever a player takes a box (s)he must move again. The board game 
ends when all 25 boxes have been taken. The player with the most boxes wins.

When all four of the lines around a single box are in place, the player who 
made the last move owns the box. The box is marked in that player’s color and 
(s)he must move again.
